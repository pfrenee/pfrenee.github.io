      <h3><em>&sect; 1.</em></h3>
      <p>
        "The world is my representation": this is a truth valid with reference
        to every living and knowing being, although man alone can bring it into
        reflective, abstract consciousness. If he really does so, philosophical
        discernment has dawned on him. It then becomes clear and certain to him
        that he does not know a sun and an earth, but only an eye that sees a
        sun, a hand that feels an earth; that the world around him is there only
        as representation, in other words, only in reference to another thing,
        namely that which represents, and this is himself. If any truth can be
        expressed <em>a priori</em>, it is this; for it is the statement of that
        form of all possible and conceivable experience, a form that is more
        general than all others, than time, space, and causality, for all these
        presuppose it. While each of these forms, which we have recognized as so
        many particular modes of the principle of sufficient reason, is valid
        only for a particular class of representations, the division into object
        and subject, on the other hand, is the common form of all those classes;
        it is that form under which alone any representation, of whatever kind
        it be, abstract or intuitive, pure or empirical, is generally possible
        and conceivable. Therefore no truth is more certain, more independent of
        all others, and less in need of proof than this, namely that everything
        that exists for knowledge, and hence the whole of this world, is only
        object in relation to the subject, perception of the perceiver, in a
        word, representation. Naturally this holds good of the present as well
        as of the past and future, of what is remotest as well as of what is
        nearest; for it holds good of time and space themselves, in which alone
        all these distinctions arise. Everything that in any way belongs and can
        belong to the world is inevitably associated with this being-conditioned
        by the subject, and it exists only for the subject. The world is
        representation.
      </p>

      <p>
        This truth is by no means new. It was to be found already in the
        sceptical reflections from which Descartes started. But Berkeley was the
        first to enunciate it positively, and he has thus rendered an immortal
        service to philosophy, although the remainder of his doctrines cannot
        endure. Kant's first mistake was the neglect of this principle, as is
        pointed out in the Appendix. On the other hand, how early this basic
        truth was recognized by the sages of India, since it appears as the
        fundamental tenet of the Vedanta philosophy ascribed to Vyasa, is proved
        by Sir William Jones in the last of his essays: "On the Philosophy of
        the Asiatics" (<em>Asiatic Researches</em>, vol. IV, p. 164) : "The
        fundamental tenet of the Vedanta school consisted not in denying the
        existence of matter, that is, of solidity, impenetrability, and extended
        figure (to deny which would be lunacy), but in correcting the popular
        notion of it, and in contending that it has no essence independent of
        mental perception; that existence and perceptibility are convertible
        terms." These words adequately express the compatibility of empirical
        reality with transcendental ideality.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus in this first book we consider the world only from the above
        mentioned angle, only in so far as it is representation. The inner
        reluctance with which everyone accepts the world as his mere
        representation warns him that this consideration, quite apart from its
        truth, is nevertheless one-sided, and so is occasioned by some arbitrary
        abstraction. On the other hand, he can never withdraw from this
        acceptance. However, the one-sidedness of this consideration will be
        made good in the following book through a truth that is not so
        immediately certain as that from which we start here. Only deeper
        investigation, more difficult abstraction, the separation of what is
        different, and the combination of what is identical can lead us to this
        truth. This truth, which must be very serious and grave if not terrible
        to everyone, is that a man also can say and must say: "The world is my
        will."
      </p>

      <p>
        But in this first book it is necessary to consider separately that side
        of the world from which we start, namely the side of the knowable, and
        accordingly to consider without reserve all existing objects, nay even
        our own bodies (as we shall discuss more fully later on), merely as
        representation, to call them mere representation. That from which we
        abstract here is invariably only the <em>will</em>, as we hope will
        later on be clear to everyone. This will alone constitutes the other
        aspect of the world, for this world is, on the one side, entirely
        <em>representation</em>, just as, on the other, it is entirely
        <em>will</em>. But a reality that is neither of these two, but an object
        in itself (into which also Kant's thing-in-itself has unfortunately
        degenerated in his hands), is the phantom of a dream, and its acceptance
        is an <em>ignis fatuus</em> in philosophy.

      <!-- <p>Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.</p>

      <p>
        For Lucy had her work cut out for her. The doors would be taken off
        their hinges; Rumpelmayer's men were coming. And then, thought Clarissa
        Dalloway, what a morning--fresh as if issued to children on a beach.
      </p>

      <p>
        What a lark! What a plunge! For so it had always seemed to her, when,
        with a little squeak of the hinges, which she could hear now, she had
        burst open the French windows and plunged at Bourton into the open air.
        How fresh, how calm, stiller than this of course, the air was in the
        early morning; like the flap of a wave; the kiss of a wave; chill and
        sharp and yet (for a girl of eighteen as she then was) solemn, feeling
        as she did, standing there at the open window, that something awful was
        about to happen; looking at the flowers, at the trees with the smoke
        winding off them and the rooks rising, falling; standing and looking
        until Peter Walsh said, "Musing among the vegetables?"--was that it?--"I
        prefer men to cauliflowers"--was that it? He must have said it at
        breakfast one morning when she had gone out on to the terrace--Peter
        Walsh. He would be back from India one of these days, June or July, she
        forgot which, for his letters were awfully dull; it was his sayings one
        remembered; his eyes, his pocket-knife, his smile, his grumpiness and,
        when millions of things had utterly vanished--how strange it was!--a few
        sayings like this about cabbages.
      </p>

      <p>
        She stiffened a little on the kerb, waiting for Durtnall's van to pass.
        A charming woman, Scrope Purvis thought her (knowing her as one does
        know people who live next door to one in Westminster); a touch of the
        bird about her, of the jay, blue-green, light, vivacious, though she was
        over fifty, and grown very white since her illness. There she perched,
        never seeing him, waiting to cross, very upright.
      </p>

      <p>
        For having lived in Westminster--how many years now? over twenty,--one
        feels even in the midst of the traffic, or waking at night, Clarissa was
        positive, a particular hush, or solemnity; an indescribable pause; a
        suspense (but that might be her heart, affected, they said, by
        influenza) before Big Ben strikes. There! Out it boomed. First a
        warning, musical; then the hour, irrevocable. The leaden circles
        dissolved in the air. Such fools we are, she thought, crossing Victoria
        Street. For Heaven only knows why one loves it so, how one sees it so,
        making it up, building it round one, tumbling it, creating it every
        moment afresh; but the veriest frumps, the most dejected of miseries
        sitting on doorsteps (drink their downfall) do the same; can't be dealt
        with, she felt positive, by Acts of Parliament for that very reason:
        they love life. In people's eyes, in the swing, tramp, and trudge; in
        the bellow and the uproar; the carriages, motor cars, omnibuses, vans,
        sandwich men shuffling and swinging; brass bands; barrel organs; in the
        triumph and the jingle and the strange high singing of some aeroplane
        overhead was what she loved; life; London; this moment of June.
      </p>

      <p>
        For it was the middle of June. The War was over, except for some one
        like Mrs. Foxcroft at the Embassy last night eating her heart out
        because that nice boy was killed and now the old Manor House must go to
        a cousin; or Lady Bexborough who opened a bazaar, they said, with the
        telegram in her hand, John, her favourite, killed; but it was over;
        thank Heaven--over. It was June. The King and Queen were at the Palace.
        And everywhere, though it was still so early, there was a beating, a
        stirring of galloping ponies, tapping of cricket bats; Lords, Ascot,
        Ranelagh and all the rest of it; wrapped in the soft mesh of the
        grey-blue morning air, which, as the day wore on, would unwind them, and
        set down on their lawns and pitches the bouncing ponies, whose forefeet
        just struck the ground and up they sprung, the whirling young men, and
        laughing girls in their transparent muslins who, even now, after dancing
        all night, were taking their absurd woolly dogs for a run; and even now,
        at this hour, discreet old dowagers were shooting out in their motor
        cars on errands of mystery; and the shopkeepers were fidgeting in their
        windows with their paste and diamonds, their lovely old sea-green
        brooches in eighteenth-century settings to tempt Americans (but one must
        economise, not buy things rashly for Elizabeth), and she, too, loving it
        as she did with an absurd and faithful passion, being part of it, since
        her people were courtiers once in the time of the Georges, she, too, was
        going that very night to kindle and illuminate; to give her party. But
        how strange, on entering the Park, the silence; the mist; the hum; the
        slow-swimming happy ducks; the pouched birds waddling; and who should be
        coming along with his back against the Government buildings, most
        appropriately, carrying a despatch box stamped with the Royal Arms, who
        but Hugh Whitbread; her old friend Hugh--the admirable Hugh!
